„ÄêProblem 1] Number of grains of rice on the 100th day

rice_list =[1]
total_num_days = 100
for i in range(1,total_num_days):
    rice_list.append((rice_list[i-1])*2)
rice_list=np.array(arr)

print("Total number of rice grains = {}".format(num_grains))

#Drawing a line graph to represent the change in the number of rice grains you received

num_days = 101

    sum_arr.append(np.sum(arr[:i+1]))
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.xlabel('Number of days'); 
plt.ylabel('Number of Rice ');
plt.legend(['Number of rice grains you receive on that day', 'The total number of rice grains you receive by that day'])

Problem 2] Number of rice grains outside of the 100th day

    list_n_grains=arr[:day]
    list_total_grains=sum_arr[:day]

plt.show()

Problem 3] How many people can live for how many days with the rice we get?

#Let's take 250 the number of grains of rice required per one people to live one day
def number_of_days_to_live(number_of_grains,number_of_people):
 days_to_live_per_one_people = number_of_grains/250
 num_days_to_live = days_to_live_per_one_people/number_of_people
 return num_days_to_live
n=number_of_days_to_live(19200,5)
print("Number of days to live = {} days".format(n//1))
#It takes approximately 400 grams or about 19,200 grains of rice to feed one adult per day according to WHO from Wikipedia
